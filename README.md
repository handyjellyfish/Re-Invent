**Very little** of this script is mine - and I take no credit for it. The majority of the script comes from the original work by Carlos Silva - whose calendar was seriously a life saver!

The code that I did add is pretty rough, but does the job. I finished it really quickly on two hours of sleep - but if you notice any major issues please feel free to send me a PR!
