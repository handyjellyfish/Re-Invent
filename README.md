# ReInvent Schedule and Markdown converter

To Run:

- Copy code from [interestToMarkdown script](interestToMarkdown.js)

- Go to your re:Invent interest page at https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/interests.ww

- Open the console and paste the code in the console window and hit enter.

- copy the markdown and save wherever you want.

Original work was done by Carlos Silva - whose calendar was seriously a life saver! https://github.com/carlosesilva/reinvent-planner

You can see the markdown that is created in [my schedule](./myschedule). If you are going to Re:Invent feel free to say hi!

The code that I added is pretty rough, but does the job. I finished it really quickly on two hours of sleep - but if you notice any major issues please feel free to send me a PR!
