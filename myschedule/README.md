#### API317-R [REPEAT] Securing Data in Serverless Applications and Messaging Services (**Chalk Talk**)
This chalk talk walks you through the process of designing a serverless application that secures customer data sent to the cloud. The design uses features recently introduced by Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS, including AWS KMS keys for encrypting messages at rest, and Amazon VPC endpoints powered by AWS PrivateLink for sending messages without traversing the public internet. These techniques are security best practices for systems that deal with private data, such e-commerce orders, candidate resumes, and employee information.

#### CTD412 Customize a "VOD on AWS" Transcoding Solution with QC, DRM, and More (**Workshop**)
Building a flexible video processing workflow for file-based media is challenging. In this workshop, learn how to deploy and customize the Video on Demand on an AWS solution and expand it to include QC, DRM, and other advanced capabilities. This well-architected solution automatically provisions services including AWS Elemental MediaConvert, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Step Functions, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3 to build a scalable, distributed, and global video-on-demand workflow on AWS.
